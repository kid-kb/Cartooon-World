in 81 countries worldwide. It is part of the Dragon Ball media franchise.Dragon Ball follows the adventures of the protagonist Goku, a strong naive boy who, upon meeting Bulma,
 sets out to gather the seven wish-granting Dragon Balls. After becoming a student of martial arts master Muten Roshi (also known as Kame Sennin), he and his fellow pupil Krillin 
enter a tournament that attracts the most powerful fighters in the world. He then sets out on his own and winds up facing and destroying the Red Ribbon Army single-handedly. When 
Krillin is later murdered after another tournament, Goku exacts revenge on his killer Piccolo Daimao. Three years later, Goku, now a young adult, must fight Piccolo Daimao's
 offspring Piccolo. The remaining 325 chapters of the manga were adapted into the Dragon Ball Z anime.
